# Building a TODO app using React and Firebase
 
Learning to create a **TODO application** using **React** and **Firebase** from *scratch* with complete **CRUD** functionality with firebase (database)

### 🔥 Firebase (Real Time Database)
### Firebase is also Hosted online
### Full CRUD functionality (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)
### Used Material-UI for front end design
### Used REACT js
### Firebase is also completly free
### Used React Hooks

##You should have a file with the following node modules inorder to create this application:

1. Default node packages which comes when you create a new react project
2. firebase tools (run in terminal, "npm install -g firebase-tools") and sudo before npm for MAC users
3. Install material UI (run in VS terminal, "npm install @material-ui/core")
4. Run in VS terminal "npm i firebase" this will install all the dependencies of firebase into the project
5. Install material UI icons (run in VS terminal, "npm i @material-ui/icons")

## In addition create a firebase account as well if you don't have one!!!


### To deploy the app
 1. Open the Terminal and navigate to the file
 2. enter "npm run build && firebase deploy"
 3. you will get a clickable link to view you app
