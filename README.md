# Building a TODO app using React and Firebase
 
Learning to create a **TODO application** using **React** and **Firebase** from *scratch* with complete **CRUD** functionality with firebase (database)

### 🔥 Firebase (Real Time Database)
### Firebase is also Hosted online
### Full CRUD functionality (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE)
### Used Material-UI for front end design
### Used REACT js
### Firebase is also completly free
### Used React Hooks

## You should have a file with the following node modules inorder to create this application:

### 1. Default node packages which comes when you create a new react project
    
    npm install
    
### 2. firebase tools (run in terminal, "npm install -g firebase-tools") and sudo before npm for MAC users
### 3. Install material UI (run in VS terminal, "npm install @material-ui/core")
### 4. Run in VS terminal "npm i firebase" this will install all the dependencies of firebase into the project
### 5. Install material UI icons (run in VS terminal, "npm i @material-ui/icons")

## In addition create a firebase account as well if you don't have one!!!


## To deploy the app
### 1. Open the Terminal and navigate to the file
### 2. enter "npm run build && firebase deploy"
### 3. you will get a clickable link to view you app



---
# In order to run the application in development mode run,
        npm start
        
### Runs the app in the development mode.
### Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
### The page will reload if you make edits.
### You will also see any lint errors in the console.
